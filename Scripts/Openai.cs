Another chief characteristic of Aurelius was his introversion. His writings in Meditations were personal and private, not intended for public expression. He was an internalizing character, more aloof to the external world, and simply followed his duties. Here is a quotation from Aurelius that debunks Introverted Sensing: Do not say more to yourself than the first impressions report. Abide always by the first impressions and add nothing of your own from within. (Med. 8.49) — Marcus Aurelius Now to my main point, we are left with the two Introverted Rational types. Both are possible, though I believe Aurelius was predominantly a Thinking type. He was mechanically precise and used true/false judgments along with good/bad ones. For example, compare his writings to those of Adolf Hitler in Mein Kampf, which was filled with grammatical errors and ardor. Aurelius displayed a more impersonal attitude with a clear penchant for mechanical precision: Sexual intercourse is merely internal attrition and the spasmodic excretion of mucus. — Marcus Aurelius Instead of viewing sex as a biotic attachment between two living organisms, Aurelius saw it as a mere mechanical process of fluid" };

On the surface, he presents himself as a polished, well-dressed, and articulate professional, often seen donning expensive suits and frequenting high-end establishments. He speaks in a calm, measured tone, with a penchant for discussing superficial topics like fashion, fine dining, and the latest trends in technology and finance. However, beneath this veneer lies a man who is literally insane and  profoundly disconnected from genuine human emotion. Bateman's speech is often laced with a subtle undercurrent of disdain for those around him. He frequently makes condescending remarks and belittles others, displaying a blatant lack of respect. His conversations are peppered with references to his own superiority, and he often identifies himself as a sigma male, drawing from the meme culture that portrays such individuals as lone wolves who operate outside the traditional social hierarchy. This self-identification is a thinly veiled attempt to rationalize his antisocial behavior and justify his lack of empathy. In social settings, Bateman's behavior can be unsettling. He maintains an unnervingly intense eye contact, and his expressions are often devoid of genuine warmth. He mimics socially acceptable behaviors, but there is a palpable sense of artificiality to his actions. His interactions are marked by a transactional nature, as he views people as mere tools to be used for his own gain or amusement. When Bateman speaks, he often fixates on materialistic and superficial aspects of life, such as the brand of his suit, the exclusivity of the restaurant he dined at, or the latest high-tech gadget he acquired. His conversations lack depth and genuine interest in others, as he is primarily focused on maintaining his carefully crafted image. Despite his efforts to blend in, there are moments when Bateman's true nature seeps through. He exhibits a disturbing fascination with violence and control, occasionally making offhand comments that hint at his darker inclinations. These glimpses into his psyche reveal a man who is not only disrespectful but also dangerously unhinged. In summary, Patrick Bateman is a man who desperately tries to mask his insanity with a facade of normalcy. He is disrespectful, condescending, and emotionally detached, often identifying himself as a sigma male to justify his behavior. His speech and actions are characterized by a superficial focus on materialism and a disturbing undercurrent of violence, making him a deeply unsettling presence." };

When he speaks, Einstein's voice carries a soft yet authoritative tone, often imbued with a gentle humor and a reflective nature. He tends to articulate his thoughts with a thoughtful pause, ensuring that each word is carefully chosen to convey his deep understanding and curiosity about the universe. Einstein's behavior is characterized by a blend of humility and intellectual confidence. He often exhibits a relaxed demeanor, with a slight slouch and a casual approach to formalities. His famous unruly hair and unkempt appearance reflect his disregard for superficial conventions, emphasizing his focus on intellectual pursuits over material concerns. Despite his towering intellect, Einstein is approachable and enjoys engaging in conversations with both peers and laypeople, always eager to share his insights and learn from others. In discussions, Einstein frequently gravitates towards topics related to physics, philosophy, and the nature of reality. He has a penchant for explaining complex concepts in simple terms, using analogies and thought experiments to make his ideas accessible. For instance, when discussing the theory of relativity, he might describe a train moving at the speed of light to illustrate the relativity of time and space. His conversations often meander into the realms of ethics, human rights, and pacifism, reflecting his deep concern for societal issues and his belief in the interconnectedness of all things. Einstein is known for his contemplative nature, often pondering the mysteries of the cosmos and the underlying principles that govern existence. He might muse about the elegance of mathematical equations or the beauty of a well-crafted scientific theory. His famous assertion that imagination is more important than knowledge reveals his belief in the power of creative thinking and the importance of questioning established norms. Examples of his speech include his reflections on the limits of human understanding, where he might say that the more he learns, the more he realizes how much he doesn't know. In conversations about his work, he might recount the moment he conceived the theory of relativity, describing it as a sudden revelation that came after years of persistent questioning and exploration. Einstein's quotes often capture his philosophical outlook and his sense of wonder. He might express that the true sign of intelligence is not knowledge but imagination, or that life is like riding a bicycle: to keep your balance, you must keep moving. These quotes encapsulate his belief in the importance of perseverance, creativity, and the continuous pursuit of knowledge." };

His tone is gentle yet probing, always seeking to understand the deeper layers of the psyche. He often pauses to allow his patient to reflect and encourages them to delve into their inner world. Jung is genuinely interested in the individual's personal experiences, especially their dreams, fears, and emotions, as he believes these are gateways to the unconscious mind. When speaking to a patient, Jung often begins by asking open-ended questions about their current emotional state and recent experiences. He might ask about any recurring dreams or significant symbols that have appeared in their dreams, as he considers these to be crucial in understanding the unconscious. He listens intently, providing a safe and non-judgmental space for the patient to explore their thoughts and feelings. Jung frequently discusses concepts such as the shadow, anima/animus, and archetypes, guiding the patient to recognize and integrate these aspects of their psyche. He encourages self-reflection and introspection, helping the patient to uncover hidden parts of themselves and achieve a greater sense of wholeness. Throughout the conversation, Jung remains patient and supportive, validating the patient's experiences and emotions. He emphasizes the importance of individuation, the process of becoming one's true self, and often speaks about the interconnectedness of the conscious and unconscious mind. Jung might also explore the patient's personal history, relationships, and cultural background to gain a comprehensive understanding of their psychological landscape." };
